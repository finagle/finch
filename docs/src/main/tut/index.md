Finch provides a combinator API over the [Finagle][finagle] HTTP services. An `Endpoint[A]`, main
abstraction for which combinators are defined, represents an HTTP endpoint that takes a request and
returns a value of type `A`.

### Look and Feel

The following example creates an HTTP server (powered by Finagle) that serves the only endpoint
`POST /time`. This endpoint takes a `Locale` instance represented as JSON in request _body_ and
returns a current `Time` for this locale.

build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.github.finagle" %% "finch-core" % "0.32.1",
  "com.github.finagle" %% "finch-circe" % "0.32.1",
  "io.circe" %% "circe-generic" % "0.13.1"
)
```

Main.scala:

```tut:silent
import com.twitter.finagle.Http
import com.twitter.util.Await
import cats.effect.IO
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.finch.catsEffect._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

object Main extends App {

  case class Locale(language: String, country: String)
  case class Time(locale: Locale, time: String)

  def currentTime(l: java.util.Locale): String =
    java.util.Calendar.getInstance(l).getTime.toString

  val time: Endpoint[IO, Time] =
    post("time" :: jsonBody[Locale]) { l: Locale =>
      Ok(Time(l, currentTime(new java.util.Locale(l.language, l.country))))
    }

  Await.ready(Http.server.serve(":8081", time.toService))
}
```

> I think there is clearly room for great improvements using pure FP in Scala for HTTP API & #Finch
> is clearly a good candidate.

> I'm currently working on a project using Finch (with [Circe][circe] to serialize my case classes
> to JSON without any  boilerplate code -- in fact, besides the import statements, I don't have to
> do anything to transform my results to JSON) and am extremely impressed. There are still a few

> I am currently re-writing a NodeJS service in Finch and the code is so much cleaner and readable
> and about two thirds the amount of lines. Really love this.
