Finch uses type classes `EncodeResponse` and `DecodeRequest` to make its JSON support pluggable.
Thus in most of the cases it's not necessary to make any code changes (except for import statements)
while switching the JSON backend.

Finch comes with a rich support of many modern JSON libraries. While it's totally possible to use
Finch with runtime reflection based libraries such as [Jackson][jackson], it's highly recommended to
use compile-time based solutions such as [Circe][circe] and [Argonaut][argonaut]. At start, Circe
would be the best possible choice as a JSON library with great performance and no boilerplate.

Use the following instructions to enable a support for a particular JSON library.

### Circe

* Bring the dependency to the `finch-circe` module.
* Make sure for each domain type there are implicit instances of `io.circe.Encoder[A]` and
  `io.circe.Decoder[A]` in the scope or Circe's generic auto derivation is used via
  `import io.circe.generic.auto_`.

```scala
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._
```

It's also possible to import the Circe configuration that uses a pretty printer configured with
`dropNullKeys = true`. Use the following imports instead:

```scala
import io.finch.circe.dropNullKeys._
import io.circe.generic.auto._
```

Unless it's absolutely necessary to customize Circe's output format (i.e., drop null keys), always
prefer [Jackson serializer][circe-jackson] for better performance. The following two imports shows
how to switch Circe to use Jackson while serializing instead of built-in pretty printer.

```scala
import io.finch.circe.jacksonSerializer._
import io.circe.generic.auto._
```

### Argonaut

* Bring the dependency to the `finch-argonaut` module.
* Make sure for each domain type there are instances of `argonaut.EncodeJson[A]` and
  `argonaut.DecodeJson[A]` in the scope.

```scala
import argonaut._
import argonaut.Argonaut._
import io.finch.argonaut._

implicit val e: EncodeJson[_] = ???
implicit val d: DecodeJson[_] = ???
```

In addition to the very basic Argonaut pretty printer (available via `import io.finch.argonaut._`),
there are three additional configurations available out of the box:

* `import io.finch.argonaut.dropNullKeys._` - brings both decoder and encoder (uses pretty printer
  that drops null keys) in the scope
* `import io.finch.argonaut.preserveOrder._` - brings both decoder and encoder (uses pretty printer
  that preserves fields order) in the scope
* `import io.finch.argonaut.preserveOrderAndDropNullKeys._` - brings both decoder and encoder (uses
  pretty printer that preserves fields order as well as drop null keys) in the scope

### Jackson

* Bring the dependency to the `finch-jackson` module.
* Make sure there is an implicit instance of `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` in the
  scope.

```scala
import io.finch.jackson._
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper
import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.DefaultScalaModule

implicit val objectMapper: ObjectMapper = new ObjectMapper().registerModule(DefaultScalaModule)
```

### Json4s

* Bring the dependency to the `finch-json4s` module.
* Make sure there is an implicit instance of `Formats` in the scope.

```scala
import io.finch.json4s._
import org.json4s.DefaultFormats

implicit val formats: Formats = DefaultFormats ++ JodaTimeSerializers.all
```
