### The big picture

There were a lot of discussions and thoughts on "What an idiomatic Finch program look like?" (see the
[Best Practices and Abstractions][issue263] issue and the [Future Finch][future-finch] writeup), but we're not sure we
should end up sticking with "one-size-fits-all" style in Finch. In fact, zero lines of Finch's code were written with
some particular style in mind, rather than reasonable composition and reuse of its building blocks. That said, Finch
will always be a _library_ that doesn't promote any concrete style of organizing a code base (frameworks usually do
that), but does promote composability and compile-time guarantees for its abstractions.

Given that major Finch's abstractions are pretty generic, you can make them [to have any faces you like][faceless]
as long as it makes programming fun again: some of the Finch users write [Jersey-style][diar] programs, some of them
stick with [CRUD-style][issue263] ones.

Note that all of the Finch examples are written in the "Vanilla Finch" style, when no additional levels of indirections
are layered on top of endpoints.

### Picking a JSON library

It's highly recommended to use [Circe][circe], whose purely functional nature aligns very well with Finch (see
[JSON docs](json.md#circe) on how to enable Circe support in Finch). In addition to a
[compile-time derived decoders][generic-decoders] and encoders, Circe comes with
[a great performance][circe-performance] and very useful features such as case class patchers and incomplete decoders.

Case class patchers are extremely useful for `PATCH` and `PUT` HTTP endpoints, when it's required to _update_ the case
class instance with new data parsed from a JSON object. In Finch, Circe's case class patchers are usually represented as
`RequestReader[A => A]`, which

1. parses an HTTP request for a partial JSON object that contains fields need to be updated and
2. represents that partial JSON object as a function `A => A` that takes a case class and updates it with all the values
   from a JSON object

```scala
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

case class Todo(id: UUID, title: String, completed: Boolean, order: Int)
val patchedTodo: RequestReader[Todo => Todo] = body.as[Todo => Todo]
val patchTodo: Endpoint[Todo] = patch("todos" / uuid ? patchedTodo) { (id: UUID, pt: Todo => Todo) =>
  val oldTodo = ??? // get by id
  val newTodo = pt(oldTodo)
  // store newTodo in the DB
  Ok(newTodo)
}
```

[Incomplete decoders][incomplete-decoders] are generated by Circe and Finch to decode JSON objects with some fields
missing. This is very useful for `POST` HTTP endpoints that create new entries from JSON supplied by user and some
internally generated ID. A Circe's incomplete decoder is represented in Finch as a
`RequestReader[(A, B, ..., Z) => 0ut]`, where `A, B, ..., Z` is a set of missing fields from the `Out` type. This type
signature basically means that a request reader, instead of a final type (a complete JSON object), gives us a function,
to which we'd need to supply some missing bits to get the final instance.


```scala
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

val postedTodo: RequestReader[Todo] = body.as[UUID => Todo].map(_(UUID.randomUUID()))
val postTodo: Endpoint[Todo] = post("todos" ? postedTodo) { t: Todo =>
  // store t in the DB
  Ok(t)
}
```

By default Finch uses Circe's `Printer` to serialize JSON values into strings, which is quite convenient given that it's
possible to _configure_ and enable some extra options (eg., to drop null keys in the output string, replace the
`io.finch.circe._` import with `io.finch.circe.dropNullKeys._` one), but it's not the most performant printer in Circe.
Always use [Jackson-powered printer with Circe][circe-jackson] (i.e., replace the `io.finch.circe._` import with
`io.finch.circe.jacksonSerializer` one) unless you absolutely not happy with its output format (i.e., want to drop null
keys).

### Do not block an endpoint

Finagle is very sensitive to whether or not its worker threads are blocked. In order to make sure your HTTP server
always makes progress (accepts new connections/requests), do not block Finch endpoints. Use `FuturePool`s to wrap
expensive computations.

```scala
import io.finch._
import com.twitter.util.FuturePool

val expensive: Endpoint[BigInt] = get(int) { i: Int =>
  FuturePool.unboundedPool {
    BigInt(i).pow(i)
  }
}
```

### Use TwitterServer

Always serve Finch endpoints within [TwitterServer][twitter-server], a lightweight server template used in production at
Twitter. TwitterServer wraps a Finagle application with a bunch of useful features such as command line flags, logging
and more importantly HTTP admin interface that can tell a lot on what's happening with your server. One of the most
powerful features of the admin interface is [Metrics][metrics], which captures a snapshot of all the system-wide stats
(free memory, CPU usage, request success rate, request latency and many more) exported in a JSON format.

Use the following template to empower your Finch application with TwitterServer.

```scala
import io.finch._

import com.twitter.finagle.param.Stats
import com.twitter.server.TwitterServer
import com.twitter.finagle.{Http, Service}
import com.twitter.finagle.http.{Request, Response}
import com.twitter.util.Await

object Main extends TwitterServer {

  val api: Service[Request, Response] = ???

  def main(): Unit = {
    val server = Http.server
      .configured(Stats(statsReceiver))
      .serve(":8081", api)

    onExit { server.close() }

    Await.ready(adminHttpServer)
  }
}
```

### Monitor your application

Use [Metrics][metrics] to export domain-specific metrics from your application and export them automatically with
[TwitterServer][twitter-server]. Metrics are extremely valuable and helps you better understand your application under
different circumstances.

One of the easiest things to export is a _counters_ that captures the number of times some event occurred.

```scala
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

import com.twitter.server.TwitterServer
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.Counter

object Main extends TwitterServer {
  val todos: Counter = statsReceiver.counter("todos")
  val postTodo: Endpoint[Todo] = post("todos" ? postedTodo) { t: Todo =>
    todos.incr()
    // add todo into the DB
    Ok(t)
  }
}
```

It's also possible to export histograms over the random values (latencies, number of active users, etc).

```scala
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

import com.twitter.server.TwitterServer
import com.twitter.finagle.stats.Stat

object Main extends TwitterServer {
  val getTodosLatency: Stat = statsReceiver.stat("get_todos_latency")
  val getTodos: Endpoint[List[Todo]] = get("todos") {
    Stat.time(getTodosLatency) { Ok(Todo.list()) }
  }
}
```

Both Finagle and user defined stats are available via TwitterServer's HTTP admin interface or HTTP endpoint
`/admin/metrics.json`.

### Use applicative request readers

Always prefer `::` (applicative builder) to compose `RequestReader`s instead of a for-comprehension (monadic builder).
An applicative `RequestReader` collects all the errors happened during its run, while the monadic `RequestReader` fails
fast on the first seen error. In addition to error collection, an applicative `RequestReader` usually performs faster,
since it evaluates its underlying futures concurrently.

```scala
import io.finch._
import io.finch.circe._
import io.circe.generic.auto._

case class Foo(i: Int, s: String)
val foo: RequestReader[Foo] = (param("i").as[Int] :: param("s")).as[Foo]
val getFoo: Endpoint[Foo] = get("foos" ? foo) { f: Foo =>
 // do something with Foo
}
```

Before writing your own `RequestReader` (as shown above), make sure it's not possible to _automatically derive_ one
using the `RequestReader.derive` method. This should _just work_ for most of the case classes (i.e., for `Foo` from the
example above).

```scala
import io.finch._

case class Foo(i: Int, s: String)
val foo: RequestReader[Foo] = RequestReader.derive[Foo].fromParams
```
