/**
 * This is a root package of the Finch library, which provides an immutable layer of functions and types atop of Finagle
 * for writing lightweight HTTP services. It roughly contains three packages: [[io.finch.route]], [[io.finch.request]],
 * [[io.finch.response]], which correspond to three simple steps to a robust REST/HTTP API:
 *
 * Step 1. Routing the HTTP requests to a `Service`.
 *
 * The [[io.finch.route.Router Router]] abstraction routes the requests depending on their path and method information.
 * `Router` combinator provides a bunch of predefined routers handling separated parts of a route. `Router`s might be
 * composed with either `/` (`andThen`) or `/>` (`map`) operator. There is also `|` (`orElse`) operator that combines
 * two routers in terms of the inclusive or operator.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val router: Endpoint[Request, Response] =
 *     Get / ("users" | "user") / int /> GetUser
 * }}}
 *
 * Step 2. Reading the HTTP requests in a `Service`.
 *
 * The [[io.finch.request.RequestReader RequestReader]] abstraction is responsible for reading any details form the HTTP
 * request. `RequestReader` is composable in both ways: via the monadic API (using the for-comprehension, i.e.,
 * `flatMap`) and via the applicative API (using the `~` operator). These approaches define an unlimited number of
 * readers out the plenty of predefined ones.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val pagination: RequestReader[(Int, Int)] =
 *     paramOption("offset").as[Int].withDefault(0) ~
 *     paramOption("limit").as[Int].withDefault(0) ~> { (_, _) }
 *   val p: Future[(Int, Int)] = pagination(request)
 * }}}
 *
 * Step 3. Building the HTTP responses in a `Service`.
 *
 * The [[io.finch.response.ResponseBuilder ResponseBuilder]] abstraction provides a convenient way of building the HTTP
 * responses any type. In fact, `ResponseBuilder` is a function that takes some content and builds an HTTP response of a
 * type depending on a content. There are plenty of predefined builders that might be used directly.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val ok: Response = Ok("Hello, world!") // plain/text HTTP response with status code 200
 * }}}
