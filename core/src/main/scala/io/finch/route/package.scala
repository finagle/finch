/**
 * This package contains various of functions and types that enable _router combinators_ in Finch. A Finch
 * [[io.finch.route.Router Router]] is an abstraction that is responsible for routing the HTTP requests using their
 * method and path information. There are two types of routers in Finch: [[io.finch.route.Matcher Matcher]] and
 * [[io.finch.route.Router Router]]. `Matcher` matches the route and returns an `Option` of the rest of the route.
 * `Router[A]` in addition to the `Matcher` behaviour extracts a value of type `A` from the route.
 *
 * A [[io.finch.route.Router Router]] that maps route to a [[com.twitter.finagle.Service Service]] is called an
 * [[io.finch.route.Endpoint Endpoint]]. An endpoint `Req => Rep` might be implicitly converted into a
 * `Service[Req, Rep]`. Thus, the following example is a valid Finch code:
 *
 * {{{
 *   def hello(s: String) = new Service[HttRequest, Response] {
 *     def apply(req: Request) = Ok(s"Hello $name!").toFuture
 *   }
 *
 *   Httpx.serve(
 *     new InetSocketAddress(8081),
 *     Get / string /> hello // will be implicitly converted into service
 *   )
 * }}}
